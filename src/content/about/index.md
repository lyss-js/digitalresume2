I'm a 23 year old front-end engineer living in New York City. I have a deep passion for anything and everything tech and I use that passion to fuel my drive to create seamless web applications that help solve complex problems.

I began my career as a user-interface designer. However, I quickly developed an interest in being able to build my own apps based on my designs, so I began working with common front-end frameworks such as React and Angular. From there, I realized that I absolutely love combining my eye for art and creativity with the analytical and programmatic side of my brain.
